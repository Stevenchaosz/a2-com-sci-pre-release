# Calculation of file locations
## Book ID: 101
hash_code = 202  
hash_val = 20200  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 101 is 20200.**

## Book ID: 334
exp = 686
hash_val = 68600  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 334 is 68600.**

## Book ID: 666
exp = 1332  
hash_val = 133200  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 666 is 133200.**

## Book ID: 900
exp = 1800  
hash_val = 180000  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 900 is 180000.**

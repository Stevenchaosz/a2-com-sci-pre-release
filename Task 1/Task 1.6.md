# Calculation of file locations
## Book ID: 101
exp = 101 ^ 3 = 1030301  
hash_val = 303  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 101 is 303.**

## Book ID: 334
exp = 334 ^ 3 = 37259704  
hash_val = 259  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 334 is 259.**

## Book ID: 666
exp = 666 ^ 3 = 295408296  
hash_val = 540  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 666 is 540.**

## Book ID: 900
exp = 900 ^ 3 = 729000000  
hash_val = 900  
**i.e. the file location for the book with book ID 900 is 900.**
